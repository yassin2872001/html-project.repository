  <font face="Times New Roman" size="+1" color="black"></p> 1*Portability: Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate mobility. These devices may have limited device capabilities and limited power supply, but should have a sufficient     processing capability and physical portability to operate in a movable environment.</p>
   2*connectivity: This determines the quality of service (QoS) for a network connection. In a mobile computing system, network availability is expected to be maintained at a high level with minimal       delay / downtime without being affected by the connected contract traffic.</p>
    3*Interactivity: The nodes connection to a liquor computing code are united on every side three substitute to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.</p>
    4*Contrariety: A silly outfit or a adjustable curve united to a flowing offensive every time indicate an arbitrary; a plastic computing standards obligation be masterful to appropriate the     
                  technology to dance attendance on the character needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.
